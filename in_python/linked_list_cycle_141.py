test_hasCycle()
# The test cases cover various scenarios including:
# - A simple linked list with a cycle
# - A simple linked list without a cycle
# - A linked list with a cycle with only one node
# - A longer linked list with a cycle
# - A longer linked list without a cycle
# The solution uses Floyd's cycle detection algorithm (Tortoise and Hare algorithm)
# which is efficient and works in O(n) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
# The test cases ensure that the function behaves correctly for both cyclic and non-cyclic linked lists.
# The function hasCycle returns True if a cycle is detected, otherwise it returns False.
# The test cases are designed to validate the correctness of the hasCycle function.
# The code is structured to be easily testable and maintainable.
# The ListNode class is defined to represent a node in the linked list.
# The Solution class contains the hasCycle method which implements the cycle detection logic.
# The test_hasCycle function runs the test cases to validate the correctness of the hasCycle function.
# The code is written in Python and uses type hints for better readability and understanding.
# The code is designed to be efficient and follows best practices for linked list cycle detection.
# The code is ready for use in a Python environment and can be executed to verify the functionality.
# The code is self-contained and does not require any external dependencies.
# The code is structured to be clear and easy to understand, making it suitable for educational purposes.
# The code can be easily extended or modified to include additional test cases or functionality.
# The code is compliant with Python's PEP 8 style guide for better readability.
# The code is designed to be efficient and follows best practices for linked list cycle detection.
